## ðŸ“‹ Example Enhanced Metric Definition

```yaml
metrics:
  - name: monthly_recurring_revenue
    label: Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
    type: simple
    description: Total recurring revenue from active subscriptions
    
    meta:
      # Importance and ownership
      importance: critical
      owner: jane.smith@company.com
      team: Finance
      
      # Freshness information
      source_freshness: "Real-time"
      update_frequency: "Every 15 minutes"
      sla: "99.9% uptime, < 1 hour delay"
      
      # Business context
      sample_questions:
        - "What is our current MRR?"
        - "How has MRR grown month-over-month?"
        - "Which customer segments drive the most MRR?"
        
      # Usage tracking
      used_in_dashboards:
        - "Executive Dashboard"
        - "Finance KPI Dashboard"
      used_in_reports:

```

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Benefits

1. **Better Discovery**: Users can quickly find critical metrics with visual indicators
2. **Clear Ownership**: Know who to contact for questions about each metric
3. **Trust Through Transparency**: Freshness information builds confidence in data
4. **Impact Analysis**: "Used By" section shows downstream effects before changes
5. **Business Alignment**: Sample questions bridge the gap between data and business needs

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

The catalog now provides:
- Rich business context for each metric
- Clear ownership and accountability
- Visual importance indicators
- Interactive filtering and search
- Comprehensive dependency tracking

All enhancements maintain backward compatibility - existing metrics without the new metadata fields will continue to work normally.
