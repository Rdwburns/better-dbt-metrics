# Example: Explicitly defined semantic models

# Define reusable entities
entities:
  - name: customer_id

# Define semantic models
semantic_models:
  - name: orders
    description: "Order fact table with measures and dimensions"
    source: fct_orders  # This becomes ref('fct_orders')
    
    # Entity definitions
