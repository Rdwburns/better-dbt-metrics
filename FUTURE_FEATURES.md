## 2. Smart Suggestions Based on Source Schema ü§ñ

### Overview
Analyzes database schema and automatically suggests relevant metrics based on column names, data types, and relationships.

### Command
```bash
better-dbt-metrics suggest --source fct_orders --source dim_customers
```

### Intelligence Features
- **Column Pattern Matching**: Recognizes common patterns
  - IDs ‚Üí count, count_distinct
  - Amounts ‚Üí sum, average
  - Dates ‚Üí time series analysis
  - Statuses ‚Üí filtered counts, conversion rates
- **Data Profiling**: Samples data to understand distributions
- **Relationship Detection**: Identifies foreign keys and suggests joins

### Example Output
```yaml
suggested_metrics:
  # Detected ID column: order_id
  - name: order_count
    type: simple
    source: fct_orders
    measure:
      type: count
      column: order_id
    confidence: high
    reason: "Primary key column detected"

  # Detected monetary columns: order_total
  - name: total_revenue
    type: simple
    source: fct_orders
    measure:
      type: sum
      column: order_total
    confidence: high
    reason: "Column name contains 'total' with numeric type"

  # Detected foreign key: customer_id
  - name: unique_customers
    type: simple
    source: fct_orders
    measure:
      type: count_distinct
      column: customer_id
    confidence: high
    reason: "Foreign key relationship detected"

# Pattern-based suggestions:
suggested_patterns:
  - pattern: "conversion_funnel"
    reason: "Detected status progression: pending -> processing -> completed"
    implementation: |
      - name: order_conversion_rate
        type: ratio
        numerator:
          source: fct_orders
          measure:
            type: count
            column: order_id
          filter: "order_status = 'completed'"
        denominator:
          source: fct_orders
          measure:
            type: count
            column: order_id
```

### Value Proposition
Dramatically accelerates metric creation for new data sources. A new fact table can have 20+ metrics suggested in seconds.

### Workflow
1. **Choose Measurement Type**
   - Count something (orders, users, events)
   - Sum values (revenue, costs, quantities)
   - Calculate average (order size, session duration)
   - Find unique values (customers, products)
   - Create a ratio (conversion rate, margin)
   - Track changes over time (growth, retention)

2. **Select Source Table**
   - Shows available tables
   - Previews column statistics

3. **Configure Measure**
   - Pick column
   - Add filters (with value preview)
   - Set aggregation type

4. **Add Time Intelligence**
   - Select time dimension
   - Configure grain
   - Add comparisons (WoW, MoM, YoY)

5. **Add Dimensions**
   - Multi-select available dimensions
   - Suggest common groupings

6. **Preview & Save**
   - Show generated YAML
   - Validate configuration
   - Save to appropriate location

### Advanced Features
- **Validation at Each Step**: "Warning: 90% of values in this column are NULL"
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-selects common options based on context
- **Preview Mode**: See sample data that would be returned
- **Explanation Mode**: Understand what each option does
- **Undo/Redo**: Step back if you make a mistake

### Value Proposition

- **Incremental Strategies**: When full refresh is too expensive

### Example Output
```yaml
metrics:
  - name: customer_lifetime_value
    # ... existing metric definition ...
    
    # üéØ PERFORMANCE HINTS ADDED:
    meta:
      performance_analysis:
        query_complexity: high
        estimated_runtime: "45-60 seconds"
        bottlenecks:
          - "Accesses 4 different source tables"
          - "monthly_churn_rate requires full table scan"
          - "No partition pruning possible"
        
        recommendations:
          - priority: high
            type: materialization
            suggestion: |
              Consider materializing as table:
              config:
                materialized: table
                partition_by:
                  field: acquisition_cohort
                  data_type: date
                  granularity: month
            impact: "Reduce query time by 90% (45s ‚Üí 4s)"
            
          - priority: medium
            type: indexing
            suggestion: |
              Add indexes on source tables:
              - fct_customer_orders (customer_id, order_date)
              - fct_customer_activity (customer_id, activity_date)
            impact: "Improve join performance by 50%"
```
